# COSC-473
COSC-473 repository

This is a README file for any comments you guys would like to leave for a reminder or any notes for the rest of the group to see.

Items will be checked off once they are fixed locally, and removed from this file once the fixes are added to the repo.

**To Do List/Checklist:**

- [x] Test Brandon's "Master Class Editor 1.0.2.jar" program on the csv files and give feedback reguarding the program in the groupme.
  1. Make sure to use the newest version of the editor.
  2. -1.0.0 - 1.0.1 When creating a new class the new line for the CSV was added to the top instead of being sorted to the correct spot.
  3. -1.0.1 - 1.0.2 There was an issue with sorting happening at 12:XXPM, which wasn't sorting by minutes, this should be fixed now.
    
- [ ] Import IUP Campus Events and Sports News using a RSS feed from the IUP website.

- [ ] Use IP address to determine what CSV file to read for class schedule section. **(Update 3/29) This feature is tentatively scheduled to be tested for part of our meeting time this week (Thursday, March 31st).**

- [x] ****BUG FIX**** The custom font that was set in cosc_monitors.css was not applying to the document. This is now fixed (**currently not in repo**) and all font is changed to use the same font style of the more up-to-date IUP web sites.

- [x] ****BUG FIX**** Randomly, the livestream will sometimes no longer automatically play on load and constantly buffer. The cause has been identified as the stream was having server issues out of our control for serveral days straight. Therefore, it was replaced with a new news live feed (**currently not in repo**).

Tentative deadline for all major functionality of web app: **Thursday, April 7th, 2016**
