This is a README file for any comments you guys would like to leave for a reminder or any notes for the rest of the group to see.


**To Do List/Checklist:**

- [x] Test Brandon's "Master Class Editor 1.0.2.jar" program on the csv files and give feedback reguarding the program in the groupme.
  1. Make sure to use the newest version of the editor.
  2. -1.0.0 - 1.0.1 When creating a new class the new line for the CSV was added to the top instead of being sorted to the correct spot.
  3. -1.0.1 - 1.0.2 There was an issue with sorting happening at 12:XXPM, which wasn't sorting by minutes, this should be fixed now.
    
- [ ] Import IUP Campus Events in some manner (thinking that IUP Sports News can be done in same way once identfied how to go about it for first case with the campus events).

- [ ] Use IP address to determine what CSV file to read for class schedule section. **(Update 3/19) Tested my approach with my local IP addresses on my laptop and desktop and it DOES read a different file depending on what machine I was running it on. All this needs is testing on the actual TV monitors and their corresponding IP addresses to make sure it 100% works.**

- [ ] ****NEW**** Allow cursor to auto-hide in view if not moved for a few seconds.

- [ ] ****BUG**** Schedule does not update when changing days on reload. Currently justs refreshes table even when grabbing new data.

- [x] ****BUG FIX**** Social media widgets do not currently refresh automatically and do not update after page load. This has now been fixed (not in repo currently).

- [x] ****BUG FIX**** News live feed was not refreshing correctly. This has now been fixed (not in repo currently).

- [ ] ****BUG**** The weather section is broken in this current build, due to a change in the API that the weather jQuery plugin used. It is fixed in the local repo and will be uploaded collectively with the other bug fixes.
