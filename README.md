# COSC-473
COSC-473 repository

This is a README file for any comments you guys would like to leave for a reminder or any notes for the rest of the group to see.

Items will be checked off once they are fixed locally, and removed from this file once the fixes are added to the repo.

**Main tasks:**

- Brandon: Work on Class Editor/COSC Events editor program.
- Daniel and Ryan: Finish off IUP Campus Events/Sports News RSS feed.
- Colton: Work on manuals and changes to design.

**To Do List/Checklist:**

- [x] Test Brandon's "Master Class Editor 1.0.2.jar" program on the csv files and give feedback reguarding the program in the groupme.
  1. Make sure to use the newest version of the editor.
  2. -1.0.0 - 1.0.1 When creating a new class the new line for the CSV was added to the top instead of being sorted to the correct spot.
  3. -1.0.1 - 1.0.2 There was an issue with sorting happening at 12:XXPM, which wasn't sorting by minutes, this should be fixed now.
    
- [ ] Import IUP Campus Events and Sports News using a RSS feed from the IUP website.

- [ ] Use IP address to determine what CSV file to read for class schedule section. **(Update 3/29) This feature is tentatively scheduled to be tested for part of our meeting time this week (Thursday, March 31st).**

- [x] Change the reload for getting the weather from 3 min to 30 min. This has been changed (not currently in repo).

- [x] Change the weather to display nothing if an error comes back and report the error to the console instead. After receiving an error, set to try and retrieve the weather again. This has been changed (not currently in repo).

- [ ] Add a refresh feature for the COSC Events & Tutoring, in case information is added during runtime.
