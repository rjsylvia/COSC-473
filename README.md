  1. Make sure to use the newest version of the editor.
  2. -1.0.0 - 1.0.1 When creating a new class the new line for the CSV was added to the top instead of being sorted to the correct spot.
  3. -1.0.1 - 1.0.2 There was an issue with sorting happening at 12:XXPM, which wasn't sorting by minutes, this should be fixed now.
